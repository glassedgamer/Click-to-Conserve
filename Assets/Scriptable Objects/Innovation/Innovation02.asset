  name: "Virtual Farmer\u2019s Market"
  description: This is an online platform that connects farmers directly with consumers.
    Instead of a physical marketplace, farmers can list their produce online, and
    customers can browse, order, and often arrange for delivery or pick-up, providing
    a convenient way to buy fresh, locally sourced food.
